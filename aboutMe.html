        <h2> Hello!</h2>
        <p> So, who is this person that made this non-functinal, ugly-ass website you may ask?</p>
        <p> Well, my name is Luis, I am 23 years old and I just started learning to code a week ago!. To be frank, I knew a little bit of html and css,
            and by knowing a little bit of html and css I mean that I can distiguish the two apart but by no means I knew how to write code!</p>
        <p>I just finished my first week at Lamda and wanted to create a page where I could keep tabs of my progess which is why I will be submitting 
            my repos to git "as is". Btw, git is awesome, I just learned how to use the terminal three days ago, and it seems so cool. After I learned it I felt confident enough to start calling myself a web developer lol.</p>
            <p> I am still not quite sure if I am going publish this website on the internet (by that I mean on a domain and then onto the internet). I am only going to be submitting to my git repository because frankly I want to make it live once I feel proud of what I can do and can actually start showing off my skills.
                So, let's keep this thread about me since that is the title of this page. 
            </p>
            <h2>Where am I from?</h2>
            <p>Excellent question!, let me start off by saying that I am from this planet. I was born in what was once the most dangerous city in the world (cd. Juarez, Chihuahua, Mexico)
                I lived in Juarez until the age of 14 years old, and then my mom decided to take me and my younger sister to the United States. So, the three of us moved to El Paso, Tx.
                I am not quite sure why my mom did not take my older sister with us, I think she was going to Uni in Juarez. Anyways,
                I am not going to go into details as to how I became a US Citizen, but what is important is that I am extremely thankful to my mom for 
                doing what she had to do in our early childhood, I understand that parents sometimes make decisions that affect children in some ways like moving into what seemed to me a different world because I did not speak a word of English, and basically knew nothing about the United States.
                So, I was in second grade of secundaria (middle school 2/3 years I believe not sure tbh ), and when I came to the United States I was set back a year, so instead of going straight to high shcool as a freshman, I was told that
                I needed to learn English before going to high school because if I went straight to high school without knowing any English I was going to have a bad time lmao.
                and that was very true!. I was then enrolled in eight grade and still had a hard time but I at least learned a little bit about how schools were run in the US.</p>
                <p> So, you might be wondering (if there is someone actually reading this other than myself) why is this dude talking about where he is going to school and stuff... well, that is because
                    to me we are all born in this one planet, borders are man made, countries are man made, we were all born in planet earth. There is no nationalism and there are no countries. I mean, of course there are but I like to see this world as a world where we are all from the same place
                    and as if we were all from the same country.</p>
