        <h2> Hello!</h2>
        <p> So, who is this person that made this non-functinal, ugly-ass website you may ask?</p>
        <p> Well, my name is Luis, I am 23 years old and I just started learning to code a week ago!. To be frank, I knew a little bit of html and css,
            and by knowing a little bit of html and css I mean that I can distiguish the two apart but by no means I knew how to write code!</p>
        <p>I just finished my first week at Lamda and wanted to create a page where I could keep tabs of my progess which is why I will be submitting 
            my repos to git "as is". Btw, git is awesome, I just learned how to use the terminal three days ago, and it seems so cool. After I learned it I felt confident enough to start calling myself a web developer lol.</p>
            <p> I am still not quite sure if I am going publish this website on the internet (by that I mean on a domain and then onto the internet). I am only going to be submitting to my git repository because frankly I want to make it live once I feel proud of what I can do and can actually start showing off my skills.
                So, let's keep this thread about me since that is the title of this page. </p>
