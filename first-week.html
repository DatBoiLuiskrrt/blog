        <h1> How was my first week of Lambda?</h1>
        <p>Well, you know how they say that the first weeks of anything
            are always meant to weed out candidates? well, I guess you
            could say that is true here at Lambda. I am typing this on a Sunday
            after my first week and about 5 people have already left our web24 cohort
            funny thing is that I could have been one of those people that left
            because I was struggling a lot not understanding the basics, and having a really 
            hard time with flex-box and how to use the commands  in Git, but hallelujah 
            I got throught it and I feel like I've already learned more in this first
            week than I had learned self-studying for about 4 months.
            Yeah, that's how much content you see and as you can see it can get very hard
            if you don't already come prepared to put it your time and effort.
            It is somewhat like if Lambda says "Hey, if you keep up with me 
            I can make you a great developer" and I believe that.
